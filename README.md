## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) [JavaScript](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-js-multicore-framework/wiki) Demo - TodoMVC
This demo is a PureMVC port of the [TodoMVC Project](http://todomvc.com), a JavaScript application framework comparison demo. Given a standard html template, css, and a plain vanilla JavaScript reference app (no framework), developers are challenged to produce implementations base upon their favorite framework. 

The pseudo-classes are written in PureMVC's optional built-in style.
